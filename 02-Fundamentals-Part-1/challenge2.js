/* Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The message can be either:

"Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".

2. Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the outputs.

Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" or "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!".

Note: Don't round the BMI values. Leave them as they are.*/

// const massMark = 78;
// const heightMark = 1.69;
// const massJohn = 92;
// const heightJhon = 1.95;

// const markBMI = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);

// const johnBMI = massJohn / (heightJhon * heightJhon);

// if (markBMI > johnBMI) {
//   console.log(`Mark BMI ${markBMI} is higher than John ${johnBMI} !`);
// } else {
//   console.log(`john BMI ${johnBMI} is higher than mark ${markBMI} !`);
// }
